## Professional Journey

As the Chief Data Scientist at Durian Corp's Data and AI Lab (DAIL), I lead a team dedicated to developing and implementing data, analytics, and AI solutions. With a background stretching over 15 years in this domain, I have honed my skills in delivering custom solutions that cater to the specific needs of our clients.

### Change Management and R&D

In my current role, change management is a key focus. This involves not just keeping pace with the rapid advancements in our field but also applying these changes in practical, client-focused ways. We're actively engaged in RAG experiments in our R&D backlog, exploring novel approaches to embeddings, developing new temporal anomaly detection systems, and enjoying a rekindled interest in Social Network Analysis and others!

## Core Expertise

### Computational Linguistics and Network Analysis

My professional foundation is rooted in computational linguistics, which has been pivotal in shaping my approach to data science. Nowadays, my work mainly revolves around network analysis. This encompasses a broad spectrum of applications from social media intelligence and OSINT to optimizing network paths. I enjoy using both traditional statistics and machine learning on large datasets, including ERP data systems, as these are critical components of my daily work.

### Research and Social Impact

For me, the most important aspect of my role is emphasizing the importance of research, especially when it comes to technology applications that yield social benefits. I have a particular interest in projects that employ mixed methods, especially those that bridge online and offline behaviors. The challenge of decoding complex patterns in digital interactions and converting these into meaningful strategies is what drives much of my work.

## Tl;dr Summary

In summary, my role at DAIL is all about applying a blend of computational linguistics, network analysis, computer vision, and AI to solve real-world problems. It's a mix of in-depth research, practical application, and a continuous pursuit of innovation in the data science arena.
